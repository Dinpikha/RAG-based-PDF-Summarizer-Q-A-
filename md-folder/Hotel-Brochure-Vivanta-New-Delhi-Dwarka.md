## INDUS EXPRESS

Located on the lobby level of the hotel, our fine dining restaurant, Indus Express, traces a vintage journey across pre-Partition, undivided India's North-West Frontier. The menu is an exceptional treasure trove of home-style recipes from Kashmir, Pothovar (present-day Peshawar), Rawalpindi, Amritsar, Khyber and Lahore. The restaurant name is derived from the five rivers Jhelum, Sutlej, Beas, Ravi and Chenab- which flow through the Indus basin region, creating a robust food trail. Family recipes from along this trail have been patiently researched and recreated by our chefs, using fresh hand-pounded masalas (spice mixes), complex cooking techniques which - often, literally - involve a trial by fire and bucketfuls of soul. The restaurant's all-white interiors, dotted with copper bartans (utensils), colonial-era maps and miniature trains, plus an alfresco section for aperitifs and conversations, build an atmosphere that prepares diners for a unique voyage, flagged off with signature exotic seeds and spice-infused almond milk drink, Khyber-ki-sardai. While meat-lovers can expect the ride of a lifetime, vegetarians cruise along on smoked and spiced aubergine, rare gucchi (morel) mushroom and lotus stem delicacies, all paired with international wines. Regular specials and a chef's table keep the Indus Express journey full of surprises with distant memories recreated at every stop.

## SIGNATURE  EXPERIENCES

## THE KABIR WALL

A short walk from the hotel lobby en route to Indus Express restaurant takes guests on a rich and soulful journey that integrates urbane design, technology, art and philosophy on a 60 ft. wall. The Kabir Wall is an exceptional collaboration between students, artists and scholars of Sant Kabir, a 15th-century Indian mystic and poet whose timeless couplets (dohas) are as - if not more - relevant to contemporary times as they were centuries ago. The dohas are scripted on the wall using entirely handcrafted calligraphy and illustrations while 3D software allows you to listen to a modern narrative driven by the soft power of Sufi mysticism at a striking and comfortable audio pod (an English translation is available in both print and audio-visual form). It is no coincidence that the Kabir Wall precedes Indus Express restaurant; the North-West Frontier province in an undivided India was where the mystic-saint travelled widely. Kabir's philosophy is deceptively simple and homegrown and is known to impact and resonate with everyone, from our jet-setting business travellers - who view the experience as a crash course in leadership - to families and children, inviting each participant to silently look within and seek his/her purpose in life, The Kabir Wall is a quiet triumph of technology, design and globally-relevant Indian philosophy.

## THE INDUS EXPRESS SAMPLER

We believe that if there's anything that beats great storytelling, it's great food. At our North-West Frontier cuisine fine dining restaurant, Indus Express, we've combined two of everyone's biggest passions for a unique experience. Diners can book the chef's table for a legendary meal that travels back in time, chugging through the Indus basin in undivided India - stopping for sumptuous courses at Kashmir, Pothovar (present-day Peshawar), Rawalpindi, Amritsar, Khyber and Lahore. Miniature toy trains - a permanent element of the restaurant décor - appear to whistle in the background as our chefs precede each course with its fascinating history. Traditional moon-shaped copper thalis (platters) and katoris (bowls) are filled with slow-cooked curries, robust racks of lamb, juicy kebabs marinated with secret spice mixes, flatbreads bubbling hot from traditional clay ovens and sinfully rich desserts. The storytelling takes delightful turns along with your taste buds. Often, a simple vegetarian dish like the Farmer's Lentil Curry reveals a complex provenance -rajma (kidney beans) from Kashmir, masoor (puy lentils) from central Asia, urad (split black gram) from Khyber, and matki (moth beans) from Punjab - cooked over hours to create a soulful dal. Meanwhile, our sommelier pairs each course with fine international wines, enhancing the spices and adding a further dimension to the meals. For a lively history lesson in tandem with a feast fit for global gourmands, book a berth on Indus Express right away.
